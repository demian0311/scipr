# Scipr

## Description
HTTP Server and Proxy in Scala.  Right now it'll just serve static files.
This is just me learning Finagle, I think it's a great library and playing
with some HTTP concepts in Scala.

## Getting Started
Start it up from sbt by running `sbt run-scipr`.
This will load it with the configuration file found in
`src/test/resources/scipr-config.xml`.
